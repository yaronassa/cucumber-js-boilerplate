# Cucumber Boilerplate Technical Readme

## General

This readme presents an overview of the project structure, as well as in depth examples and details of the possible implementations and code structures.

Make sure you read the [general reame](README.md) and go through the installation process before proceeding.


## Project overview
This project includes 5 main segments

- Run engine that handles setting up the env., parses run arguments and configurations, reporting to external systems, and running the automation tests.
- Cucumber test features with business logic scenarios.
- Cucumber step infrastructure that connects scenario sentences (e.g. "I login as user A") to facade functions.
- Automation infrastructure that actually carries out the facade function calls against internal memory and the test environment.
- Meta-test infrastructure, that tests the automation infrastructure itself

### Run engine
The main access point to the automation is through the `testRunner.js` file.
It uses helpers under `runHelpers/` to parse run arguments, cucumber results and output streams; and actually launch Cucumber and run the automation tests.

The main configurable arguments you can pass to the file are:

- `--configFile SOMEFILE`. Load override configuration from the specified json file (is searched under `config/`).
- `--tags=@someTag`. Run only scenarios tagged as @someTag. You can use any cucumber tag syntax multiple times (e.g. `--tags=@includeMe --tags=~@excludeMe`).

TODO: more config options

### Cucumber test features
These are stored under `src/features`, and include all the `.feature` files there.

### Cucumber infrastructure
This includes all the files under `src/features/support` and under `src/features/step_definitions`.
These are standard cucumberJS support files, with the addition that the cucumber world object has a `.facades` property which leads into the infrastructure facade functions.

### Automation infrastructure
This includes everything under `src/infrastrcture`. Each automation class has a `._infra` property which leads back to the `src/infrastructure/automationInfrastructure.js` root object.
Cucumber infrastructure can only access the facades defined within `facades` (leading into the object sub-tree defined in `src/infrastructure/cucumberFacades/`), and they branch out to operate the entire automation infrastructure to carry out the required business logic.

### Meta-test infrastructure
This segment includes everything in `test/`, and basically mirror the structure of The cucumber infrastructure and the automation infrastructure.
The meta-test infrastructure relies on `config/testConfig.js` to force cucumber into running the features library in `test/features/`, as well as the support code included there.
Similarly to the regular infrastructure, the meta-test cucumber world has a `.testCucumberFacades` property, leading into its infrastructure. 
Besides providing automation facades, `.testCucumberFacades` also provides access to the regular automation infrastructure object tree via `TestInfrastructure.automationInfrastructure`, so you can access, manipulate and meta-test all the infrastructure objects and behaviours.

**Please note** - The meta-test infrastructure is only loaded when the `config/testConfig.js` configuration file is loaded. 
It's not part of the regular infrastructure run lifecycle.

You can read about the Meta-Test framework in detail in the [meta-test readme](metaTest_readme.md).

## Run lifecycle

When a regular test suite runs, i.e. when launching `./testRunner.js`, the following sequence is executed (directories may change if the relevant configuration options are overridden):

*testRunner.js*

- Prepares the file-system for the new run (cleaning old results, etc.).
- Aggregates the configuration and run parameters, and calculates the parameters for the cucumber launch.
- Launches cucumber via the `runHelpers/cucumberRun.js` wrapper.
- After cucumber exists, parses the output, exports relevant reports (html, slack, etc.).

*CucumberJS*

- Is launched via its CLI object with the relevant arguments.
- Scans `src/features/step_definitions/` for step definitions, and loads them all.
- Scans `src/features/support/` for support files, and loads them all.
  - Specifically, `src/features/support/world.js` defines the cucumber World object, and attaches a `.facades` property to a new `cucumberFacades` object facades.
  - This constructs the singleton root of the infrastructure object (see below).
  - Also, `src/features/support/hooks.js` connect cucumber event to the automation infrastructure test event handlers.
- When the tests execute, events trigger the infrastructure event handles, and steps trigger its facades.
- Exists when all cucumber features have been exhausted.
  
*AutomationInfrastructure.js*

- Is constructed by cucumber's World object initialization.
- Loads the entire infrastructure module hierarchy (everything is initialized as a singleton object instance).
- Listens to cucumber events through `src/infrastructure/testFlow/testFlow.js` event handlers.
- Reacts to cucumber steps through `src/infrastructure/cucumberFacades/` step handlers (called from cucumber step definition files).
- Usually exists once cucumber AfterFeatures hook has ran, and CucumberJS has exited.

## Automation infrastructure classes

The following outlines the automation infrastructure structure under `src/infrastructure/`

#### AutomationInfrastructure 
Main Access point for the entire class structure. 

Its constructor has a `createNew` parameter (default=false), which if set to true, builds a new object (with an entirely new class structure) and returns it instead of the singleton root object.
Creating this class will recursively create and initialize the entire infrastructure object tree.

#### Assert
- Assertion services and logic. Any and all validations are performed in this class structure.
- The different sub-classes correspond to the applicative area to assert (currently only has an `assertEntities` subclass).
- Most assertion functions should work with an expected result structured as an array of `{fieldName, fieldValue}` objects, built by `Parser.parseFieldPairs`.
- This will allow the assertion functions to use `Assert.compareObjectToExpectedSpec` - a generic comparison function with overridable options and extensions.

#### CucumberFacades
- Contains the business-logic functions that are called by the cucumber steps.
- Are split into an object sub-tree of applicative areas. It's best practice for this sub-tree to mirror the step definition files structure.
- All functions **must** return a bluebird promise result.
- Assume facade functions may be called from other functions as well as from the cucumber steps.

#### Data
- The `Data` class stores all the run, feature and scenario information about created entities and operations performed by the infrastructure.
- Most of the information is stored in `TestPhaseData` objects. These objects are aggregated and used to reset the environment at the end of the test phase. See [Test Environment](#TestEnvironment) for more details.

#### Logic
- Contains all the processing and logic manipulation on the system's entities and business processes. 
- Unlike functions under `Services`, logic functions work internally, and don't access the test environment by themselves (this also means they are synchronous).

#### Services
- Contains wrappers for actions against outside services, apis and other tools that are not constrained to the internal data representation of the infrastructure.
- Basically, if a wrapper activates something outside of this folder structure, it should be under services. 

#### TestEnvironment
- Used as the external gate for accessing the manipulating the test environment.
- Currently only houses stubs and mocks. A real-world example would have sub-structures for api, db, fs and other manipulations as needed.

#### TestFlow
- Handles the test flow, and keeps records of test phase durations, statuses and exceptions.
- The `TestFlow._hooksHandlers` structure houses functions that are called by the cucumber hook with the corresponding name.
- Most `TestFlow._hooksHandlers` functions have an array of hook actions to perform (**must** return a promise), that are called sequentially by `TestFlow._runHookActions`. 
- The `TestFlowMetaHelpers` class contains utils that manipulate the way the test flows and response to commands. These utils run cucumber step-functions through a processing pipeline that can alter their results and success criteria (for example, flip future step results when using "The next N steps should fail" step).

**Notable cucumber hooks**:
- BeforeFeatures - The first hook that's called and executed. Used as the infrastructure's a-synchronous init hook (environment building, listener inits, etc.). This is the only hook that stops the entire run if it fails.
- BeforeScenario - Used mostly to clean the restructure the internal infrastructure data.
- AfterScenario - Used to reset the environment by cleaning scenario created entities.
- AfterFeatures - The last hook that's called and executed. Used as the infrastructure's a-synchronous teardown hook.

##### Utils
- Houses helpers and processors, some of them use and manipulate the test environment asynchronously.
- `LogHelper` controls the stdout and cucumber out logs, allowing suppression and manipulation of outgoing logs.
- `Parser` used for unstructured information parsing and processing. Mostly used to break down cucumber steps unstructured information, in order to be sent to validation functions and other utilities.
- `VariableProcessor` - Used to parse plain-text phrases and expressions from cucumber steps. Most frequent uses: parsing complex data types (arrays, regexps), accessing created entities properties (retrieve claim id, etc.), and constructing assert-test objects in `VariableProcessor.getTestable`, which encapsulates many assertions, tests and comparisons.
- `passwordManager` - Used to load the decrypted password object from the password file (defaults to `passwords/outputtedPasswords.json`).
